  desc: "We combined a bunch of inference from CPU performance counters with some gory binary rewriting to move highly and falsely-contented memory regions onto their own cachelines.  The latter half of this system made up my M.Sc. thesis work."

  venue: "HotSec"
  school: "UBC"
  desc: "What started as a joke at the pub one night turned into a fun workshop paper, where we applied the most naive ML techniques imaginable to reverse-engineer the identities of CS conference paper reviewers from public sources.  At least one reviewer was not amused by the final line in our acknowledgements section!"
