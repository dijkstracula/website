Before joining UT, I was a sessional instructor and TA at various universities
in Canada.  As I'm funded as a graduate research assistant by my advisor I've
not been involved with any teaching at UT, but I hope to one day find the
excuse to return to the front of the class.

## Ancient history

### MacEwan University

At MacEwan, I was a lecturer and lab instructor in the Department of Computing
Science.  I redesigned _CMPT 220: Unix, Scripting, and Other Tools_, which
hitherto had mostly been a course reiterating first-year programming exercises
in Bash, with the goal of covering as many upper-level OS concepts in a _de
facto_ introductory course.  It turns out: we were able to dig deep into
material as diverse as the process lifecycle, signals, containerization, binary
exploitation, and metaprogramming using straightforward Unix primitives!  [The
course
material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8YYcprmNUiA61SuZvRFcw7IshJ7ETLYiqlyteu8_tw/edit)
was well-received by students, and even made the rounds on certain colour-coded
tech aggregator websites, which was pretty cool.

Additionally, I developed a streamlined summer curriculum for _CMPT 201:
Practical Programming Methodology_, the introductory C language course.  201
has the unfortunate reputation among students of being a "weed-out" course,
and the accelerated schedule in the summer term doesn't help matters.  To that
end, I dropped the ancient, overpriced textbook in favour of a [free, modern C
resource](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/pdf/bgc_usl_c_1.pdf), corrected numerous
inaccuracies in the existing course material (ranging from implicit but
harmless reliance on undefined behaviour up to total falsehoods), and exised
any material that stood in the way of students becoming formidable systems
programmers.

### University of Toronto

At the start of the pandemic I was hired to teach [CSC324: Principles of
Programming Languages](http://individual.utoronto.ca/nbtaylor/csc324_s2020) at
the University of Toronto (a different UT!).  This was my first time teaching
a course entirely on my own; but, seeing as how feedback from students included
_"You are one of the best professors I had in three years at the UofT. Thank
you for explaining the materials so well"_, I like to think that the university
made a good choice!

### UBC

For UBC's then-brand new [Racket-based introductory CS
course](https://web.archive.org/web/20090918115923/http://sites.google.com/site/ubccpsc1102009w1/),
I taught lab sessions, held scheduled office hours, and on occasion, lectured
during instructor absences.  For my work I was awarded a graduate TA award by
the University (a gold star!)
