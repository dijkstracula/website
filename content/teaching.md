Before joining UT, I was a sessional instructor and TA at various universities
in Canada.  As I'm funded as a graduate research assistant by my advisor I've
not been involved with any teaching at UT, but I hope to one day find the
excuse to return to the front of the class.

## Ancient history

### MacEwan University

At MacEwan, I was a lecturer and lab instructor in the Department of Computing
Science.  I redesigned _CMPT 220: Unix, Scripting, and Other Tools_, which
hitherto had mostly been a course reiterating first-year programming exercises
in shell scripts, with the intention of covering as much undergraduate OS
course material in a _de facto_ introductory course without assuming any
systems programming or C background.  It turns out: we were able to dig deep
into content as diverse as file system internals, signals, containerization,
CtF challenges, and metaprogramming using straightforward Unix primitives!
[The course
material](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1aquigBI-hdkbWcrNSrJNHIYejQzKA5KU)
was well-received by students, and even made the rounds on certain colour-coded
tech aggregator websites, which was pretty cool.

Additionally, I developed a streamlined summer curriculum for _CMPT 201:
Practical Programming Methodology_, the introductory C language course.  I
dropped the ancient, overpriced textbook in favour of a [free, modern
C resource](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/pdf/bgc_usl_c_1.pdf), corrected numerous
inaccuracies in the existing lecture material, and exised any material that
stood in the way of students becoming formidable systems programmers.

### University of Toronto

At the start of the pandemic I found myself inbetween jobs, and was brought in
to teach [CSC324: Principles of Programming
Languages](http://individual.utoronto.ca/nbtaylor/csc324_s2020) at the
University of Toronto (a different UT!).  Feedback from students included _"You
are one of the best professors I had in three years at the UofT. Thank you for
explaining the materials so well."_, so, I like to think that the university
made a good choice!

### UBC

For UBC's then-brand new [Racket-based introductory CS
course](https://web.archive.org/web/20090918115923/http://sites.google.com/site/ubccpsc1102009w1/),
I taught lab sessions, held scheduled office hours, and on occasion, lectured
during instructor absences.  For my work I was awarded a graduate TA award by
the University (a gold star!)
