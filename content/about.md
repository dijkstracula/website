## About me

{{<figure class="avatar" src="/~ntaylor/me.jpg" alt="">}}

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Texas at
Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) in the [Department of Computer
Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/), where I'm working with [James
Bornholt](https://cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/) and [Ken
McMillan](http://mcmil.net/wordpress/) on applying formal methods to concurrent
and distributed systems.

Prior to joining UT, I was lucky to live in beautiful [Oakland,
CA](https://localwiki.org/oakland/), where I scaled low-level systems and
infrastructure at [some
companies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dijkstracula/resume/master/resume.pdf)
that you may have heard of.  Outside of industry, I was a software developer at
[Microsoft
Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/ai-for-systems/) as
well as a lecturer at [Macewan
University](https://www.macewan.ca/academics/academic-departments/computer-science/)
and the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu).

I hold a M.Sc. from the [University of British
Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), where [Andy
Warfield](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~andy/) and I hacked on hypervisor-level
dynamic analysis tools.  I also hold a B.Sc. from the [University of
Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) in chilly
[Edmonton,
AB](https://www.ualberta.ca/earth-sciences/facilities/edmonton-river-valley.html).

Exciting things will eventually appear here!
