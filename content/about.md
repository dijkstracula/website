## About me

{{<figure class="avatar" src="/~ntaylor/me.jpg" alt="">}}

I'm a PhD student at [UT Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/), where I'm working
with [James Bornholt](https://cs.utexas.edu/~bornholt/) on applying formal
methods to concurrent and distributed systems.

Prior to joining UT, I lived in beautiful [Oakland,
CA](https://localwiki.org/oakland/), where I hacked on low-level systems and
infrastructure at some companies that you may have heard of.  Outside of
industry, I worked as a contract software developer for [MSR
NYC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/ai-for-systems/) and served
as a sessional lecturer at [Macewan
University](https://www.macewan.ca/academics/academic-departments/computer-science/)
and the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu).

I have a Master's degree from the [University of British
Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), where [Andy
Warfield](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~andy/) and I hacked on hypervisor-level
dynamic analysis tools, as well as a Bachelor's degree from the [University of
Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html).

Exciting things will eventually appear here!
